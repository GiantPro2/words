    "Welcome to WORDS, - a game in which contestants have to form words based on a series of letters which are displayed on a screen. The letters all come from car registration plates from various countries around the world.",
    "The game can be played by 2 to 5 individual players or teams.  There are 12 rounds per game.",
    "Before playing, enter your name or the name of your team.  This name will be stored and can then be chosen from the menu shown at the start of each new game.",
    "In turns, each contestant/team is shown a series of letters on a number plate randomly selected from a country around the world. ",
    "Within 20 seconds, as many words as possible must then be formed using all of the letters displayed and in the same order as they appear. For example, using the combination WFA, the responses DEWFALL, SNOWFALL and NEWFANGLED would be valid while the word WATERFALL would not (the letters W – A – F are not used in the correct order here, W must be followed by F before A).",
    "Players can also include their own rules regarding what consitutes a correct answer, for example, both the singular and plural form of a word (e.g. HAT and HATS) can be accepted or not; proper nouns (e.g. London, Helen, Jupiter) can be accepted or not, and so on.",
    "Players agree on who will keep count of the words spoken, this can be one or two or more other players.",
    "The person/team saying the words stops when the countdown shows ’0’ and the ‘STOP’ sound is played. No other words given after this time are valid.",
    "An opponent can challenge the validity and correctness of a word or words given by his/her fellow competitor. This is done by pressing the ‘CHALLENGE’ button on the screen. The timer is stopped and the word in question is entered into the dictionary which appears on the screen.  If the word is correct, i.e. it is found in the dictionary, then the challenger/challenging team loses one point for each word challenged. Should the challenge be sustained, i.e. the word is not found in the dictionary, then one point is awarded to the challenger and one point is deducted from the player/team per wrong word uttered.",
    "The button ‘PLAYBACK’ plays back what was said by the person/team whose turn it is and can be used to count the words spoken in case of a disagreement or to check on an individual word in case of a challenge.",
    "The button ‘FACTS’ can be pressed and then background information about the country in question, e.g. the number of registered cars there, how the numbering system works, when number plates were first introduced, etc. is displayed.",
    "The winner is the person/team who has said the most words at the end of the 12 rounds.",
    "Scores are saved and a performance ranking can be called up.",
    "We hope you enjoy playing WORDS.",
